# App Engine ~ Beanstalk?

```
App Engine will scale your application automatically in response to the amount of traffic it receives. Thatâ€™s why App Engine is especially suited for applications where the workload is highly variable, like a web application. Services are a modular abstraction in app engine, a way to break up the application into separate parts.

- go
- php

Sandbox:
- can't write to local file system
- req timeout 60 seconds
- third party binaries aren't allowed

Deploy and test locally -> deploy with SDK -> App engine

### Flexible

Application instances run within Docker containers on Compute Engine virtual machines (VM).

- Java 8
- python 2.7/3.6
- node.js
- ruby
- go
- php
- .NET core
- docker

No sandbox constraints, can connect to instances, uses compute engine VMs,

- 60 minutes request timeout
- no scaling to zero, minimum 1 instance
- write access to ephemeral local disk
